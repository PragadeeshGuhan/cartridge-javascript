## Config

Once installed, the config file `task.scripts.js` is created and stored in the `_config` directory in the root of your cartridge project.

## Usage

This module provides the following gulp tasks

* `gulp scripts` - Task that runs all of the tasks mentioned below.
* `gulp scripts:bundle` - Concatenates all JS files into one file. When the `--prod` is provided the concatenated file is also minified. Sourcemaps are generated by default when no `--prod` flag is provided.
* `gulp scripts:lint` - Lints all JS files. Ignored if `--prod` is provided.
* `gulp scripts:docs` - Generates JS docs, for when [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/) are used in source file.

Try and adhere as closely as possible to the [Angular commit messages guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines).

[Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is a command line tool which can help with this:
